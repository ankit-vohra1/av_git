**PYTHON SKILLS**

1) **multiprocessing_demo.py**<br>
   This has sample code for implementing multiprocessing functionality using Python; utilizing all cores of operating system for running multiple jobs together.
In practice, I have:<br>

    i) Implemented Python multiprocessing for running multiple adhoc-reports in parallel. Thereby completing job of generating 10 reports in under 2 mins rather earlier 12-15 mins.<br>
    ii) Implemented Python multiprocessing with Pipe functionality (to share information among processes and return counts) for multi-file loading in Lambda.


2) **thesarus.py**<br>
   This program uses data.json as source, parses it and then searches it to find required word, thus implemnting offline dictionary like functionality.


3) **utils.py**<br>
This has 2 files: UtilsSmartsheet.py and utils.py.<br>
These 2 demonstrates Object-oriented programming skills and code reusability skills.<br>
UtilsSmartsheet.py has several methods which are used for initilizing a Smartsheet, adding Or deleting rows from a Smartsheet and also implements Retry logic functionality.<br>
We create an instance/object of UtilsSmartsheet in actual program and then call various methods of UtilsSmartsheet class via same instance.<br>
utils.py has various functions which can be called from diffrent Python programs thereby providing code reusability.

**SQL SKILLS**

1) **fn_data_checks_details.sql**<br>
   PostgreSQL function to return results in TABLE format.
   Here I have used dynamic queries with RETURN NEXT record feature.
   We do proper EXCEPTION handling and error logging for troubleshooting any issues.  

2) **league - Postgres**<br>
This is an entire project for implementing a Basketball league functionality.
Details of requirements and expected functionality of this application is in attached document "Application Information Document - MODEL.docx"
We generate team, player etc data on the fly. 

Thanks
